Comment[Submitted Name]	Th2 differentiation in a time course experiment and at single generation resolution
Experiment Description	Mouse splenic na√Øve T cells were activated (with anti-CD3/CD28)and polarized towards the Th2 subtype with IL4 .  Cells were collected at different time points during the differentiation and, at day 3 .5,were collected according to number of cell divisions and expression or absence of a specific differentiation marker.

Protocol Description	Spleens were collected from mice between 6-12 weeks old	Untouched naive cells were purified from the spleen with negative selection protocol.	Cells were grown in complete IMDM 10% FBS, in presence of IL4 (10ng/ml)	Libraries were prepared according to Illumina Paired End sequencing Protocl	Spleens were mashed through a 70nm strainer to obtain single cell suspension	Illumina Hi-seq 2000 was used to sequence the libraries	For each sample, reads were aligned to the Mus musculus genome (GRCm38) using GSNAP with default options (Wu and Nacu, 2010).	Only reads uniquely mapped to the genome were counted for each gene using htseq-count. Samples are normalised with size factors calculated from DESeq.
